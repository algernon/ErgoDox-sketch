algernon's ErgoDox EZ firmware
==============================

This is my work in progress firmware Sketch for the [ErgoDox EZ][ez], using [Kaleidoscope][ks] together with a fair amount of plugins.

This is a reasonably complete example of how to work with the firmware and surrounding libraries to extend it, to compose the various components, to have something useful in the end.

 [ks]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope
 [ez]: https://ergodox-ez.com/

It is a heavy work in progress, with some awful hacks and workarounds here and there. Eventually these will be cleaned up.

It is based on my previous [ErgoDox EZ layout][ergodox-layout] (with QMK), a lot of things are common between the two.
